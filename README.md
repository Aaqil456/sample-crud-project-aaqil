Challenges And how I face it

1.  
Challenge: Learning react framework for the first time
Solution: Use youtube tutorials and chat gpt to understand the file structure in react framework and how to integrate between each file when doing an app

2.  
Challenge: Need to learn again how to functinality use data structure in a to implement Create, Read, Update, Delete
Solution: Use chat gpt to make the learning process faster by understanding and see examples of implementation in codes

3.  
Challenge: Displaying a "No items added" message when there are no items in the list.
Solution: Added a conditional check in the React component to display a message when the items array is empty, otherwise rendering the list of items.

4.  
Challenge: Relearn CSS to make the forms neat
Solution: use external resources such as [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) to relearn CSS fast
